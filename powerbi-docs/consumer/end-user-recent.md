# Recent content in the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yynn](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yynn.md)]

**Recent** content is the last items you visited in the Power BI service. Recent content includes: dashboards, reports, apps, semantic models, workspaces, scorecards, and workbooks. When you select **Recent** from the Home pane, Power BI displays this content in descending order by date.  To change the sort order, select one of the headings and choose ascending or descending.

**Recents** can also be opened from the nav pane. Select **Browse** > **Recents**.

## Search and sort your list of recent content

If your lists get long, use the **Filter by keyword** field, **Filter** button, and column sorting function to find what you need.

- Enter a keyword into the **Filter by keyword** field to show recent content that includes that keyword.
- Use the **Filter** drop-down to sort your content according to the content type or any of the column headers.
- Click a column heading to display a sorting arrow. In this example, hovering over **Location** reveals the sort arrow.

## Add content to your Favorites list

The actions available to you from **Recents** depend on the settings assigned by the content designer. One useful feature is the ability to add content to your list of favorites. 

Black stars appear when you hover over content that is already a favorite. To make content one of your favorites, select a white star to turn it black. ![star icon](media/end-user-recent/power-bi-star-icon.png)
