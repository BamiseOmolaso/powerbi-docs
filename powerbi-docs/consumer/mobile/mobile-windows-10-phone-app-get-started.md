The Power BI app for Windows brings Power BI to your Windows device. You get up-to-date, touch-enabled access to your business information. You can interact with all the Power BI reports, dashboards, and apps that are available to you in the Power BI service - both those that you've [created](../../fundamentals/service-get-started.md) yourself as well as those that have been created by others and shared with you. All this from the Power BI app for Windows.

## Find your content in the Power BI app for Windows
