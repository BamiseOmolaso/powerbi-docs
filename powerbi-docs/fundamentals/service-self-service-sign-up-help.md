# What to do if sign-up is disabled

You tried to sign up, start a trial, or purchase Power BI and received a message that sign-up is disabled. For various reasons, some organizations block members from self-service sign-up, self-service trial, and self-service purchase. For example, your organization might have a policy that all licenses and subscriptions are managed by a centralized IT department or help desk, even free licenses.
