# Sign up or purchase Power BI as an individual

This article explains how individuals can sign up or purchase Microsoft Power BI for themselves. 

This article is for business users who want to sign up for or purchase Power BI themselves. If you're part of an organization where your administrator assigns the licenses directly to you, then this article isn't for you. 

This *self-service* method includes buying a paid license, starting trials, and getting free or paid licenses that an admin makes available for users in an organization. If the term self-service is new to you, or if you're an administrator who manages self-service, visit [Self-service for Microsoft 365 products and services](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/manage-self-service-purchases-admins) or [What is self-service](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/self-service-sign-up).

If you're unable to sign up or to purchase Power BI, it might be because your admin disabled self-service options. Contact your administrator and ask them to [enable self-service sign-up and self-service-purchase.](../enterprise/service-admin-licensing-organization.md#enable-and-disable-self-service-sign-up-and-purchase)

## Look up your current license or trial

You may already have a Power BI license or trial. To learn more, see [licenses and trials](../consumer/end-user-license.md#find-out-which-licenses-you-have) to learn how to look it up.

#### [Free sign-ups and trials](#tab/free-sign-ups-and-trials)

### Activate a license for an organizational subscription

Your organization purchased a Power BI subscription that includes licenses. Self-service is enabled. Open Power BI in a browser (app.powerbi.com) to activate a license for yourself. The license you're assigned depends on the organizational subscription and self-service settings. 

If you never used Power BI before, you can activate your license by selecting a link in email. Colleagues share Power BI items in email, and selecting a one of these links initiates signing up for a license. 

Another way to activate your license is to select a **Try free** or **Upgrade now** button. 

### Start a trial

Microsoft offers trials of licenses. 

#### Start a Power BI individual user trial

If you already have a free license and try to use an advanced Power BI feature, Power BI displays upgrade prompts. Depending on your configuration, you might receive prompts to join a trial or to make an upgrade purchase, or both.

#### Start a Microsoft 365 trial of Pro

If you don't have a work or school email account, you can still start a trial of Power BI Pro. To start a trial, [sign up for a trial of Microsoft Office 365 E5](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md). This version of Microsoft Office 365 includes a Pro license. The Microsoft 365 trial includes up to 25 licenses. Your Microsoft 365 trial lasts for 30 days. After the trial ends, cancel the trial before your credit card is charged. You become the admin for the new domain. 

For more information about the Microsoft 365 trial, see [sign up for Power BI with a Microsoft 365 trial.](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md) 

#### [Purchase](#tab/purchase)

### Buy a license

There are many ways to buy a license. Three are described here. Use in-product prompts, your Account manager, or the Microsoft pricing site.

#### Buy a license using an in-product prompt

#### Buy a license using your Account manager

Open your Account manager from the upper right corner. Select **Buy Pro now**. You have access to your Account manager if you already have a Power BI license.

#### Buy a license from a commercial site

You can also purchase Pro or PPU licenses from the [Microsoft pricing site](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/), through Microsoft 365, or through a Microsoft partner.

For example, to purchase Power BI PPU, scroll to **Power BI Premium** and under **Per user** choose **Buy now**.

## Close your account, cancel your subscription, end your trial

You can always close your account, cancel your subscription, or end your trial. Each of these actions has a different set of procedures and considerations. For more information, see [Close your account, cancel your subscription, end your trial](/fabric/enterprise/fabric-close-end-cancel).

## Considerations and troubleshooting

- If you have a subscription for Microsoft 365 E5, you have a Pro license. 
- You can sign up for or purchase Power BI with .gov or .mil addresses, but this approach requires a different process. For more information, see [Enroll your US Government organization in the Power BI service](../enterprise/service-govus-signup.md).
- If you're unable to use self-service to get your own Power BI license, check to see if your administrator disabled this option. The admins who manage the domain can disable self-service sign-ups, self-service purchases, upgrades, and free trials. For help when you can't use self-service, go to [Self-service sign up and purchase help](service-self-service-sign-up-help.md).

- If you're an admin, [learn how to enable and disable self-service.](../enterprise/service-admin-disable-self-service.md)

- Direct purchase or an upgrade to Pro or Premium Per User isn't available to educational organizations or organizations deployed to Azure Government or Azure China 21Vianet clouds.

- This article describes the self-service process for the **Power BI service.** If you're looking for help with downloading Power BI Desktop or with installing the mobile apps, refer to these articles:

- [Power BI Desktop (free download)](desktop-get-the-desktop.md)
- [Power BI mobile apps (free download)](../consumer/mobile/mobile-apps-for-mobile-devices.md)

- If you're part of an organization and used self-service to purchase Power BI, the Global or Billing admin for your organization can [**take over** ownership](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/domains-admin-takeover) of your subscription, and then assign or unassign licenses.
