# Sign up or purchase Power BI as an individual

This article explains how individuals within an organization can sign up for Power BI or purchase Power BI for themselves. 

These *self-service* methods include buying a paid license, starting individual trials, and getting free licenses if your organization allows self-service. If the term self-service is new to you, or if you're an administrator who manages self-service, visit these admin articles [What is self-service?](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/self-service-sign-up) and [Self-service for Microsoft 365 products and services.](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/manage-self-service-purchases-admins).

If you're unable to sign up for Power BI or to purchase Power BI, it might be because your Microsoft 365 Global administrator disabled self-service options. Ask them to [enable self-service sign-up and self-service-purchase.](../enterprise/service-admin-licensing-organization.md#enable-and-disable-self-service-sign-up-and-purchase)

## Look up your current license or trial

You may already have a Power BI license or trial. To learn more, see [licenses and trials](../consumer/end-user-license.md#find-out-which-licenses-you-have) to learn how to look it up.

#### [Free sign-up](#tab/free-sign-up)

## Sign up for a free license

Your organization purchased a Power BI subscription that includes licenses. Self-service is enabled. Sign up by:

1. Opening Power BI in a browser (app.powerbi.com).
1. Selecting a **Try for free** type of button. 
1. Selecting a Power BI link in an email. Colleagues share Power BI items in email. If you never opened Power BI before, selecting one of these links initiates signing up for a license. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/power-bi-email.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an email that contains a Power BI link.":::

All of these actions sign you up for a per-user license and open the Power BI service in a browser. The type of license assigned to you depends on your organization's subscription and self-service settings. To learn more about the types of licenses, see [Power BI license types](../consumer/end-user-license.md).

If the Power BI service doesn't open or if you receive an error message, it's possible that your organization doesn't have a Power BI subscription. See [Email validation](#email-validation) to learn what steps to take to get a per-user license.

### Email validation

The first time you attempt to sign up for a license, Microsoft asks for your email address. 

If your organization didn't purchase Power BI, you're redirected to a sign-up process. This alternate sign-up process creates an account and possibly even creates a new tenant.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/power-bi-no-account.png" alt-text="Sign-up screen that appears if you don't already have a Power BI account.":::

For more information about creating a Microsoft account, see [How to check if your email address is a Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/how-to-check-if-your-email-address-is-a-microsoft-account-b3ba5b92-5ead-4a28-adc9-b40558bb697e)

#### [Individual trial](#tab/trial)

## Start a trial

Microsoft offers a few different trials that assign you a Power BI license. You can sign up for a trial of the paid version of Power BI, sign up for a trial of Microsoft 365, or sign up for a trial of a Fabric capacity. 

### Start a Power BI individual user trial

If you already have a Fabric (Free) license and try to use a feature that requires a paid license, Power BI displays upgrade prompts. Depending on your organization's subscription and self-service settings, you might receive prompts to join a trial or to make an upgrade purchase, or both. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/fabric-prompt.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing dialog with message to Upgrade to a paid Power BI license.":::

### Start a trial of a Fabric capacity

Another way to start a trial of a paid Power BI license is to [start a trial of a Fabric capacity](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial). The trial includes a license similar to Power BI Premium Per User (PPU). Open your Account manager and select **Start trial.**

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/power-bi-account-manager.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Account manager showing Start trial.":::

### Start a Microsoft 365 trial of Pro

If you don't have a work or school email account, you can still start a trial of Power BI Pro or Fabric (Free). [Sign up for a trial of Microsoft Office 365 E5](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md) and create an *onmicrosoft* email account and a new tenant. The Microsoft 365 trial includes up to 25 licenses and you become the admin for the new tenant. The E5 version of Microsoft Office 365 includes a Pro license. A credit card is required to sign up, so be sure to cancel the trial before 30 days if you aren't ready to purchase.  

For more information about the Microsoft 365 trial, see [sign up for Power BI with a Microsoft 365 trial.](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md) 

#### [Purchase](#tab/purchase)

### Buy a license

There are many ways for an individual to buy a license. Three are described here. Use in-product prompts, your Account manager, or the [Microsoft Power BI pricing site](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-bi/pricing).

#### Buy a license using an in-product prompt
 
If you already have a license and try to use a Power BI feature that requires a paid license, Power BI displays upgrade prompts. Depending on the self-service options that your organization enabled, you might receive prompts to join a trial, or to make an upgrade purchase, or both. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/fabric-prompt.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing dialog with message to Upgrade to a paid Power BI license.":::

#### Buy a license from the Account manager

Open your Account manager from the upper right corner. Select **Buy now**. You have access to your Account manager if you already have a Microsoft Fabric or Power BI license.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi/fabric-pro-buy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Account manager with Buy Pro now outlined in red."::: 

#### Buy a license from a commercial site

You can also purchase Pro or PPU licenses from the [Microsoft Power BI pricing site](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-bi/pricing).

## Close your account, cancel your subscription, end your trial

You can always cancel your free subscription, cancel a purchase, or end your trial. Each of these actions has a different set of procedures and considerations. For more information, see [Close your account, cancel your subscription, end your trial](/fabric/enterprise/fabric-close-end-cancel).

## Considerations and limitations

- If you have a subscription for Microsoft Office 365 E5, you have a Pro license. 

- If you're a Global administrator or Billing administrator, licensing and subscription information is available in [Power BI licensing for your organization](../enterprise/service-admin-licensing-organization.md).
- 
-  If you're a Global administrator or Billing administrator, you might not want users in your organization to use self-service sign-up. To learn how to disable self-service, visit [Enable or disable self-service.](../enterprise/service-admin-disable-self-service.md)

- This article describes the self-service process for the **Power BI service.** If you're looking for help with downloading Power BI Desktop or with installing the mobile apps, refer to these articles:

- [Power BI Desktop (free download)](desktop-get-the-desktop.md)
- [Power BI mobile apps (free download)](../consumer/mobile/mobile-apps-for-mobile-devices.md)

- If you're part of an organization and used self-service to purchase Power BI, the Global or Billing admin for your organization can [**take over** ownership](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/domains-admin-takeover) of your subscription, and then assign or unassign licenses.

In most cases, you can sign up for the Power BI service and for Fabric by following the described processes. Some of the issues that might prevent you from signing up are described here, with possible workarounds.

- Your organization doesn't support self-service upgrades. Pay for the new license yourself. After you sign in, you select how many licenses you want to buy, and to provide credit card payment. When the purchase is complete, you can start using your paid licenses. You also have access to a limited view of the Microsoft 365 admin center where you can assign licenses for the product to other people in your organization.

- Your organization has its own process for self-service sign-ups and purchases. Follow those steps instead to request a license.

- You can sign up for or purchase Power BI with .gov or .mil addresses, but this approach requires a different process. For more information, see [Enroll your US Government organization in the Power BI service](../enterprise/service-govus-signup.md).

- Self-service purchase of Pro and PPU licenses isn't available to educational organizations or organizations deployed to Azure Government or Azure China 21Vianet clouds.

- If you're unable to use self-service to get your own Power BI license, check to see if your Microsoft 365 Global administrator disabled the self-service options. Also check with the Fabric administrator to see if they changed the upgrade and trial options available to you. For help when you can't use self-service, go to [Self-service sign up and purchase help](service-self-service-sign-up-help.md).

### Can't access your Fabric items

- If you're using a Power BI Premium capacity, Microsoft Fabric items aren't supported. To enable support for Microsoft Fabric items on your Power BI capacity, [enable Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/admin/fabric-switch).

- If you're using Microsoft 365, certain versions include a free Fabric license and a free or paid Power BI license. For example, the E5 SKU includes a Fabric free license (but no capacity) and a Power BI Pro license. Without a trial or purchased capacity, you might not be able to access your Fabric items. To learn how to look up your user license, see [what license do I have?](../consumer/end-user-license.md)

### Personal email addresses

**Personal email addresses**
 You attempted to sign up using a personal email address (for example nancy@gmail.com) and you received a prompt similar to one of these messages. 

*You entered a personal email address: Enter your work email address so we can securely store your company's data*.

*That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don't worry. We don't share your address with anyone*.

The Power BI service doesn't support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunications providers. To finish signing up, try again using an email address assigned by your work or school. 

If sign up still doesn't work, try a more advanced setup process.  [Register for a new Microsoft 365 trial subscription and use that email address to sign up.](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md)

You can also have an existing user [invite you as a guest](../enterprise/service-admin-azure-ad-b2b.md).

[!INCLUDE[self-service-signup](../includes/self-service-signup-help.md)]

### Your email address isn't a Microsoft 365 ID

You attempt to sign up or purchase and receive a message like this:

*We can't find you at contoso.com. Do you use a different ID at work or school? Try signing in with that ID. If it doesn't work, contact your IT department.*

Your organization uses IDs that are different than your email address to sign in to Microsoft 365 and other Microsoft services. For example, your email address might be `zalan.bola@contoso.com` but your ID is `zalanb@contoso.com`.

To finish signing up or purchasing, use the ID that your organization assigned to you for signing in to Microsoft 365 or other Microsoft services. If you don't know what this ID is, contact your Global administrator.  

If you still can't sign up or purchase there's a more advanced setup process available. [Register for a new Microsoft 365 trial subscription and use that email address to sign up](../enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial.md).

### I'm trying to use Power BI Desktop

To download the free Power BI Desktop, see [Get Power BI Desktop](desktop-get-the-desktop.md).

### Sign-in doesn't recognize your password

Sometimes it takes a few tries. If you retry your password several times and you still can't sign in, try running your browser in Incognito (Chrome) or InPrivate (Microsoft Edge) mode.

### You don't receive in-product prompts

You don't see prompts to upgrade (Buy now) or start a trial (Try now), and the UI doesn't display **Try now** or **Buy now** buttons.

The type of upgrade and trial options available to you depends on how your administrator set up your domain. Your administrators have the ability to disable all trials, disable self-service purchase, and more.
