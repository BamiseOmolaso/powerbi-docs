# Fabric and Power BI support options

This article describes the support options that are available to end users who have purchased Microsoft Fabric or Power BI. Power BI administrators and other admins in your organization have access to expanded support options. Read [Commonly used Microsoft 365 admin center roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles#commonly-used-microsoft-365-admin-center-roles) to learn more about who can manage service requests for your organization. To learn about Microsoft Fabric (Preview) for administrators, see [Microsoft Fabric admin](/fabric/admin/microsoft-fabric-admin).

## Get started with support

Many resources are available to help you identify, research, and solve issues.  From the top menu bar, select the **?** **> Get Help** to open the Fabric and Power BI Support site. The [Fabric and Power BI support site](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/support) has links to documentation, Community, known issues, troubleshooting, and a Support dashboard. If you Fabric or if you have a paid version of Power BI, options to contact Microsoft Support directly are available from the **Help and support** site. 

> [!Note] 
> If you got your Power BI Pro or Premium-per-user (PPU) license through a guest affiliation with another organization, you can't contact support. Your license must be assigned directly by the organization that manages your work or school account to enable support options.

## Before you contact support

Verify whether Microsoft support is your admin's preferred option when you need help. To check, select (**?**) from the page header in the Power BI service, then choose **Get Help**. If this selection takes you to Power BI support, you might use the following listed support options. Otherwise, you'll be directed to the preferred support option for your organization. If your product doesn't have a support contract, you'll receive a message that "This product is not supported."

As a Power BI customer, you can also take advantage of the following offerings for proactive support hours:

At the end of this assessment, you'll receive a comprehensive Power BI report of results, a detailed best practice guidance deck, and a summary report tailored to your environment.

* **Activate Business Analytics with Power BI**. This offering is designed to help you to implement a real-life scenario and enable Power BI for your organization. Work side-by-side with an expert over three days, developing a proof-of-concept in Power BI, with the objective of improving one of the following scenarios:
  * Scenario 1: Power BI Solution Development. Your organization already has a data warehouse or data marts in place, or your department wants to explore data that isn't in the corporate store yet. The support expert can prototype a Power BI solution that will connect to your data and extract meaningful insights using Power BI models and reports. Common data sources include Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse (DW), or on-premises data using Enterprise Data Gateway.
  * Scenario 2: Adoption, Governance, and Administration. The focus here is on establishing a framework for Power BI governance and operational processes. We'll review your infrastructure, discuss key components in typical Power BI deployments, and recommend practices for governance, administration, and management of Power BI.
  * Scenario 3: Enterprise Scale Data Analytics. The focus in this scenario is on developing Power BI Premium models or migrating existing AAS/SSAS models to Power BI. We consider key components, advantages, and limitations of Power BI Premium capacity management and migrations to Power BI Premium from existing enterprise analytics infrastructure.

* **WorkshopPLUS - Data AI: Business Analytics with Power BI**. This workshop is a great introduction to Power BI, making it an excellent starting point for adoption or for ramping up your users. It will provide you with a complete overview of Power BI functionality and capabilities and covers both Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service. You'll learn in detail how to build calculations and reports, transform data, and build a model. You'll also learn best practices around sharing and governing that content in the Power BI service. You can also expect many demonstrations and labs, so you can experiment and see the technology in action.

* **WorkshopPLUS - Data AI: Advanced Data Analytics with Power BI**. This offering presents how you can implement the key principles of data modeling in Power BI, using tools such as Power BI Desktop and the accompanying cloud service for the publishing and consumption of Power BI assets. You'll develop reports, including DAX, and use premium capacities in Power BI. You'll also deal with advanced analytics involving AI components, Premium, and Data flows.

* **Power BI Clinic**. This offering presents how you can optimize your Power BI workload. Use this clinic as a proactive service to help optimize performance before deploying Power BI, or as a reactive service to alleviate existing bottlenecks. You'll have an opportunity to work with a Microsoft SME (subject matter expert) on performance tuning and optimization of slow running Power BI reports, with a focus on report models and DAX. You'll also have an opportunity to work on slow semantic model refresh with a focus on refresh performance in the Power BI cloud service or Power BI Report Server.
