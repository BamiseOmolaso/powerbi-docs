## X-axis settings

### Type

The **Type** setting within x-axis options is only available when you choose a single data field that is either numerical or date/time.

[!INCLUDE [xaxis-type-type](../includes/core-visuals/xaxis-type-type.md)]

### Range

The availability of **Range** settings depends on configuring the x-axis **Type** as **Continuous**. Once the X-axis Type is specified as Continuous, you can access and adjust all the Range settings shown below.

[!INCLUDE [axis-range-maximum](../includes/core-visuals/axis-range-maximum.md)]
[!INCLUDE [axis-range-minimum](../includes/core-visuals/axis-range-minimum.md)]
[!INCLUDE [axis-range-logarithmic-scale](../includes/core-visuals/axis-range-logarithmic-scale.md)]
[!INCLUDE [xaxis-range-invert-range](../includes/core-visuals/xaxis-range-invert-range.md)]




## Considerations and technical aspects

### Considerations
- Display units suffix changes according to location/system settings. 
- Axis colors defined by conditional formatting are based to a general value rather that by individual category.
