# Create a (new) card visualization in Power BI Desktop (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-no-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-no-service.md)]

The (new) card is a helpful visual that presents important metrics such as total sales, profit growth, count of opportunities, and performance status. You can create cards for the metrics that align with your objectives and key results (OKRs) and display them grouped in a single visual container.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/power-bi-opportunities-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows card visualization.":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The (new) card visual is currently in preview and only available for Power BI Desktop. This information relates to a prerelease product that may be substantially modified before it's released. Microsoft makes no warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

## Prerequisites

To share your report with a Power BI colleague, you must both have individual Power BI Pro licenses, or you must save the report in Premium capacity. The card visual applies only to Desktop and isn’t available in Power BI service.

### Considerations and limitations (preview)

* The new card visual is currently being developed and updated over several releases. Once it reaches its final stage, it replaces the existing Card, Multi-row card, and KPI card. However, reports that continue to use these older visuals will still be supported.
* Certain settings only take effect if the **Apply settings to** option is set to **All**. Other settings can only be configured by selecting an independent measure series.
* By design, the shadow and glow effect can cause the size of all cards to change unexpectedly.
* **Edit interactions** and **Filters in this visual** influence all cards within the container.
* You can't pin individual cards to a dashboard. Instead, all cards in the new card visual are pinned together.
* There are no limits to the number of cards that you can add to the new card visual. However, adding a large number of cards might cause the report to experience latency and slow data loading.
* The new card visual currently doesn't support scrolling or pagination. As a result, if the container is small and you add multiple cards, they might appear in a reduced size.
* The new card visual is a preview feature turned on by default. If you prefer to disable the preview, or control when you see it:
    1. In the Fabric Admin settings, go to **Options**.
    1. Then select **Preview features**.
    1. Turn off **New card visual**.

    This change doesn’t influence existing card visuals.

1. At the bottom, select the green plus symbol :::image type="icon" source="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/add-1.png"::: to add a new page to the report.


## Build a new card visualization

# [On the ribbon](#tab/On-the-ribbon)

The first way to create a new card is to use the ribbon in Power BI Desktop.

1. In the **Insert** ribbon, select **Visual gallery**, then select the **Card (new)** visual icon. When the visual placeholder appears, a dialogue box that says **Suggest a visual** is automatically displayed. You can close this dialogue box before moving to the next step.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/insert-visual-gallery-new-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Insert menu with the visual gallery ribbon expanded to show the Card (new) visual selected, and the dialogue box ‘Suggest a visual’ is displayed." lightbox="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/insert-visual-gallery-new-card.png":::

1. To add fields or measures, select **fields** in the **Data** pane. Add the **StoreCount** and **TotalSalesTY** data fields. Each data field you add is displayed as its own card.
 
   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/add-data-data-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Data panel open with two data fields selected and afterwards added to the visual, creating two distinct cards." lightbox="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/add-data-data-pane.png":::

# [On the report canvas](#tab/On-the-report-canvas)

A second way to create a card is directly from the report canvas.

1. In the report canvas, right click to display a menu, then select **Add visual**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/canvas-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a menu that appears when the user right clicks on the canvas. The menu shows an option to add a new visual." lightbox="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/canvas-1.png":::

1. In the **Suggest a visual** menu, expand the Visual types dropdown to select the **Card (new)** visual icon.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/canvas-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an empty container with the visual dialog highlighting the card (new) icon selected." lightbox="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/canvas-2.png":::

1. To add fields or measures, select **Add data**. Add the **StoreCount** and **TotalSalesTY** data fields. Each data field you add is shown as its own card.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/canvas-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a card with both the Store count and Total Sales fields visible. The Data section, where the fields were added, is also shown in the same view." lightbox="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/canvas-3.png":::

# [In the data pane](#tab/In-the-data-pane)

Another way to create a new card visual is to start from the Data pane.

1. In the **Data** pane, select the **StoreCount** and **Value** data under **TotalSalesTY**. This automatically creates a container on the canvas that shows the selected data.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/data-pane-new-visual.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a container with two data measures that were selected from the Data pane." lightbox="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/data-pane-new-visual.png":::

1. On the **Home** ribbon, select the **Visual gallery** and then select the **Card (new) visual**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/visual-gallery-new-card-style.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a card with Visual gallery highlighted in the Home ribbon. The Card (new) visual icon is also highlighted in the dropdown menu, in the same view." lightbox="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/visual-gallery-new-card-style.png":::

## Format the new card visual

The new card visual provides a wide range of options for customization. To better understand these options, create a new card visual with multiple values and explore the **Format** pane. This way you can experiment with various formatting options and discover the full range of features available.

1. Select the new card and choose the paint brush icon to open the **Format** pane.

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/format-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a Format pane icon that opens up all available formatting settings for a card (new)." lightbox="media/power-bi-visualization-new-card/format-1.png":::

1. To change all cards at the same time, first, expand the **Callout values** and the **Values** sections.
1. Under **Apply settings** to section, select **Series All**.

1. Then you can select and change **Font family**, then **Font size**, **Color**, **Transparency**, and **Horizontal alignment**. This changes all the cards at the same time. Apply the following settings for this exercise:
