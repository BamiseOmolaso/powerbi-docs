## Overview

A column chart, commonly referred to as a vertical bar graph, is a visual tool utilized to display and compare numerical data across different categories. Each column within the chart corresponds to a specific category, with the height of the column proportionally representing the associated value. This design facilitates an intuitive comparison of values across various categories or over distinct time periods. Column charts are frequently employed in the realms of business and finance to illustrate key financial metrics, including revenue, expenses, and profits. Additionally, they serve as a valuable asset in marketing for the depiction of data points such as sales figures, market share, and customer demographics.

The guide illustrated below provides a step-by-step walkthrough for constructing a column chart visual, encompassing both the Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service platforms.
