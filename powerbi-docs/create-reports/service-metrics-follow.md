# Follow your metrics

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Use the _Follow_ functionality to quickly access metrics you’re interested in and stay up to date on the activity on these metrics. You can follow metrics as you’re browsing through different scorecards and later access all your followed metrics in one place. This makes it easy to get a quick overview of the metrics you care about, without having to navigate to different scorecards often.

To follow, hover over the metric in the scorecard to select the **Follow metric** icon.

To see all your followed metrics, go to the Metrics hub and select **Following**.

Once you follow a metric, you'll get Teams notifications whenever the metric definition is updated, a check-in is added, or an automated status rule changes the status of the metric. Read more about [notifications in Teams](../collaborate-share/service-teams-notifications.md).

To unfollow and stop getting Teams notifications, hover over the metrics and select the **Unfollow metric**.
