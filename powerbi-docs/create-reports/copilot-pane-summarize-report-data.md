# Use Copilot to summarize your report data 

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

 The Copilot pane in Power BI is now available in public preview in view and edit mode and offers new capabilities. You can now ask Copilot for summaries, insights, and answers from your report content. In this blog post, we’ll dive into the exciting capabilities of Copilot, unveiling how it empowers users to extract invaluable insights in view mode from their data effortlessly. 

Copilot in View Mode 

Imagine having a knowledgeable assistant by your side as you navigate through your Power BI report. That’s precisely what the Copilot pane brings to the table within Power BI. Users, in view mode, can generate summaries of their report content with just a few clicks. Gone are the days of endless manual analysis — Copilot streamlines that process, delivering concise overviews that illuminate key trends, patterns, and insights across your visuals.  With this capability, business users can get an overview of their report page, as well as ask questions about the data visualized on the page, elevating their data exploration experience and empowering them to dig deeper. This capability is powerful as it elevates the typical viewing experience to an analysis experience. Note: this capability is also available in edit mode. 

Customized Guidance at Your Fingertips 

As mentioned, Copilot doesn’t just stop at providing overviews and insights of report content – with customizable requests, Copilot tailors its assistance to your specific needs, guiding you through the exploration process with ease. Whether you’re unsure where to begin or you’re seeking deeper insights, Copilot is there to lend a helping hand.  You can start with the out of box prompts like: 

Create a bulleted list of insights 
Summarize visuals on this page 
Give an executive summary of this report

Or you can start to aid deeper and more nuanced exploration into key slices of your data with custom requests that deliver tailored insights and answers.  Here are some examples of custom requests to get you started: (keep in mind, the requests should be specific to the data in the report you’re viewing) 

What are some key sales insights on this page? 
What are some interesting customer segments? 
What is the relationship between product type and revenue?

Copilot will scan the report page visuals and answer your request in natural language, making analysis of the report easier than ever.  From uncovering insights to highlighting key sales metrics, Copilot’s prompts pave the way for unparalleled data discovery. You can even copy and paste the Copilot text into emails, power points, or Teams threads to keep everyone up to date. 

 

Unleashing the Power of Questions 

Another exciting aspect of Copilot’s consumption mode is its ability to respond to your questions in real-time. Need to know which team dominated in sales or which product boasted the highest profit margin? Simply ask, and Copilot will provide you with a tailored, simple response. What sets Copilot apart is its knack for referencing specific visuals within your report, making it easier than ever to understand the underlying data driving each insight and answer. Here are some examples from a real example: 

What is the highest grossing product? 
What was the total sales in 2021? 
What is the average length of stay?

These capabilities are also available in edit mode, and in Desktop
