# Enable Fabric Copilot for Power BI

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

This article is for organizations who would like to enable and start using Copilot in Microsoft Fabric, specifically in Power BI. We present how to enable Copilot in your tenant, start using Copilot in the Power BI service, and start using Copilot in Power BI Desktop.

For more information on other Fabric workloads, see the [Copilot in Fabric overview](/fabric/get-started/copilot-fabric-overview). Note, you must have Fabric admin privileges to enable Copilot.

Before your business can start using Copilot for Power BI, you need to enable it in the Microsoft Fabric Admin Portal. There are two main settings related to Copilot that admins need to be aware of:

- [Enable Copilot setting](#enable-copilot-setting)
- [Enable sharing data across geographic boundaries](#enable-sharing-data-across-geographic-boundaries)

## Enable Copilot setting

1. Navigate to the [Tenant settings](/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-copilot) in the Fabric Admin portal and use the **Search** feature to locate the Copilot settings.

1. **Toggle the switch on** to Enable Copilot in Fabric.

    Enabling Copilot in Fabric means that users can access Copilot across workloads. This means Copilot access isn't limited to a specific workload, like Power BI.

    1. Use the search bar (or scroll) to find the **Copilot and Azure OpenAI Service (preview)** settings.
    1. Toggle the switch to the on position.
    1. Specify who can access Copilot in Fabric. Select **Apply** to save your changes.

## Enable sharing data across geographic boundaries

Enabling this setting only applies if Azure OpenAI isn't available in your geographic region.

- If Azure OpenAI isn't available in your geographic region, you need to adjust one additional setting. This means that your data may be handled outside of your area.
- If youâ€™re okay with your data being handled outside of your area, switch on the setting **Data sent to Azure OpenAI can be processed outside your capacity's geographic region, compliance boundary, or national cloud instance**, and select **Apply**.

## Licensing requirements

To use Copilot for Power BI, you must have access to a Premium Power BI capacity (P1 and above) or paid Fabric capacity (F64 and above). Your capacity (either Premium or Fabric) needs to be in one of the regions listed in this article, [Fabric region availability](/fabric/admin/region-availability).

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot in Microsoft Fabric isn't supported on trial SKUs. Only paid SKUs (F64 or higher, or P1 or higher) are supported.
