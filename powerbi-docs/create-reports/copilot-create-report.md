# Get started creating reports with Copilot

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

When you use the Copilot chat pane in Power BI, Copilot helps you use the transformational power of generative AI to get the most from your data. This article provides an overview of the Copilot chat pane capabilities for Power BI.

Before you create reports, consider [evaluating your data model](copilot-evaluate-data.md) to see if Copilot can understand it easily. 

With the current preview, you can create reports faster and easier in the Power BI experience. You can now open the Copilot pane and ask Copilot to:

- **Summarize a semantic model**: Copilot can help you understand your Power BI semantic model by summarizing the data in your model. This summary can help you gain a better understanding of your model, identify important insights, and improve your data exploration experience by allowing you to delve deeper into the data.
- **Suggest a topic**: Copilot can help you get started on a new report by suggesting topics based on your data. When you select this option in the chat, Copilot evaluates the data and provides a report outline with suggested pages that you can explore, and Copilot can create them for you.
- **Create a report page**: Copilot  for Power BI can assist you in creating a report page by identifying the tables, fields, measures, and charts for your data. If you give Copilot a high-level prompt that's specific to your data, it can generate a report page that you can then customize and modify using the existing editing tools. It can help you get started on your report page quickly and save you a lot of time and effort in the process. The following are some examples of high-level prompts to get you started:

  - Create a page to evaluate the performance of different shifts based on good count, reject count, and alarm count over time.
  - Create a page to analyze the efficiency of the production line and overall equipment effectiveness.
  - Create a page to compare the cost and material of each product and their impact on production.

## Start using Copilot

The same report creation experience is available for preview in the Power BI service and in Power BI Desktop.

- [Create reports in the Power BI service with Copilot](copilot-create-report-service.md)
- [Create reports in Power BI Desktop with Copilot](copilot-create-desktop-report.md)

If you need help with writing prompts that get you the report page you want, see [Write Copilot prompts that produce results in Power BI](copilot-prompts-report-pages.md) for guidance.

## Create a summary

You can also use Copilot for Power BI to create a narrative summary with just a few clicks. This narrative can summarize the entire report, specific pages, or even specific visuals. See [Create a narrative summary visual with Copilot for Power BI](copilot-create-narrative.md) to learn how.

## Undo a page

After Copilot has generated the report, you can review the page. You have the option to start over by selecting the **Undo** button.  After you select the **Undo** button, Copilot starts over. The content on the page is removed and you start over with topic selection by either generating new topics or selecting the one from the top, when you first started.

## Save the report

When you're satisfied with the report, you save the report just like any other report.
