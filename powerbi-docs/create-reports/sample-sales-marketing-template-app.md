# Download a sample template app from AppSource

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

The Marketing and Sales *template app* is available from Microsoft AppSource. A template app is a Power BI content type that combines related dashboards and reports. Template apps can have one or more dashboards and one or more reports, all bundled together. You can download the Marketing and Sales template app from **Apps** in the Power BI service, or by going to AppSource in your browser.

1. To download the template app from AppSource, go to [Sales & Marketing template app](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/power-bi/microsoft-retail-analysis-sample.salesandmarketingsample?tab=Overview). Select **Get it now**.
1. Microsoft AppSource asks you to **Sign in**. You can sign up for a free account.
1. Complete the profile information, then select **Continue**.
1. Select **Install**.

After you install it, you see it in your collection of apps. Here you see it in **List** view.
