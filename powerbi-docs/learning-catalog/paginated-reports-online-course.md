## Attendee kit

You can download and set up an attendee kit, which consists of the presentation content and nine hands-on labs:

1. Use [this link](https://aka.ms/priad-en) to download the _English_ language attendee kit (.zip) locally to your PC (Windows 8, or later). Alternatively, use [this link](https://aka.ms/priad-student) to download the _localized_ attendee kit (.zip) locally to your PC (Windows 8, or later).
1. Open the file properties of the zip file, and check "unblock" (Windows may flag the file as potentially untrusted).
1. Create a root course folder. We recommend you name it something like "C:\Training". Remember this location, because you'll need to access the course files during the labs. All lab documents refer to this location as **&lt;CourseFolder&gt;**.
1. Extract the **PowerBIPRIAD-Attendee.zip** file contents to your root course folder.
1. In the **&lt;CourseFolder&gt;\PowerBIPRIAD\Lab01A** folder, open the PDF lab document and follow the lab instructions.

> [!NOTE]
> In the localized attendee kit, you will find documents for the following eight languages:
> - German (de-DE)
> - Spanish (es-ES)
> - French (fr-FR)
> - Italian (it-IT)
> - Japanese (ja-JP)
> - Korean (ko-KR)
> - Portuguese, Brazilian (pt-BR)
> - Chinese, simplified characters (zh-CN)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You're responsible for having your own Power BI account. If you don't already have one, see [Sign up for or purchase the Power BI service as an individual](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md). A newly signed up account can benefit from a 60-day trial license.
>
> To complete the labs, you must sign in to Power BI to publish a Power BI Desktop file to a workspace. The publication results in a dataset that's used as a report data source.
