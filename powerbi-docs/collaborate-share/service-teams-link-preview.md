# Get a Power BI link preview in Microsoft Teams

When you paste a link to your reports, dashboards, and apps into the Microsoft Teams message box, the link preview shows information about the link. Link previews are provided for the following items in Power BI:

- Reports
- Dashboards
- Apps

See [Collaborate in Microsoft Teams with Power BI](service-collaborate-microsoft-teams.md) for background on how Power BI and Microsoft Teams work together, including requirements you need to meet.

1. Copy a link to a report, a dashboard, or an app in the Power BI service. For example, copy the link from the browser address bar.

1. Paste the link in the Microsoft Teams message box. Sign in to the link preview service if prompted.
