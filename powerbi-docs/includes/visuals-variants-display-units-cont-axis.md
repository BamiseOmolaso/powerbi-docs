## Display units

This setting offers several options for defining the Display units but only when the axis is configured asÂ Continuous:

- **Auto**: The unit adjusts dynamically based on the data value's magnitude.
- **None**: Displays the value as is, without any unit.
- **Thousands**: Divides the value by 1,000 and appends a "K" suffix.
- **Millions**: Divides the value by 1,000,000 and appends an "M" suffix.
- **Billions**: Divides the value by 1,000,000,000 and appends a "B" suffix.
- **Trillions**: Divides the value by 1,000,000,000,000 and appends a "T" suffix.
