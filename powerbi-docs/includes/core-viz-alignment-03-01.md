## Match value alignment

When enabled, and the **Apply settings to** has been set to **Series all**, this toggle ensures that horizontal alignment of all labels match the alignment of the data values. When the toggle is not enabled, the horizontal alignment options are available, allowing you to align the text to the left, center, or right according to your liking.
